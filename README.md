FLUME-TOOLS 

- The goal of flume-tools is to make a modular set of tools to process all of the data coming from our flume experiments. Ideally, this will be both comprehensive and easy to use after they are developed.

Modules of interest include:
- orthomosaicing of GoPro data
- general video editing functionalities (extract image sequences, extract portions of video, image brightening, transfering GoPro data from etc)
- PIV?
- processing SICK data
- DEM of differencing
- processing of Massa data
